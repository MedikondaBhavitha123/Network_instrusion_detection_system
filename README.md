# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Introduction
This project focuses on a **PCAP-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using a signature-based detection approach. Unlike anomaly-based NIDS, this system analyzes network traffic for known attack patterns and signatures to identify potential security threats.

## Features
- Analyzes **PCAP files** for network traffic.
- Detects various types of attacks, including:
  - **ARP Cache Poisoning**
  - **DoS Attacks**
  - **Port Scanning**
  - **Suspicious User Agents**
  - **Potential Malware Patterns**
- Built using **Python, Flask, Scapy, HTML, and CSS**.
- Provides a user-friendly web interface for easy analysis.

## Usage
- Upload a **PCAP file** through the web interface.
- The system processes network traffic and identifies potential threats.
- Results are displayed in an easy-to-read format.

## Results
- The system provides detailed alerts on detected threats.
- Displays insights such as **packet count, traffic distribution, and potential intrusions**.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of **Machine Learning** for anomaly detection.
- Enhanced **real-time monitoring** capabilities.
- Improved visualization and reporting.
